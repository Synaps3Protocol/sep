# SEP-001: Multimedia Metadata in Decentralized Systems

**Status:** Draft **|** **Category:** Standards

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to propose a standard for transmitting and managing multimedia resources over decentralized systems. The goal of this standard is to achieve interoperability, security, and federation of such resources.

> "JWTs represent a set of claims as a JSON object that is encoded in a JWS and/or JWE structure."

The proposed standard uses JSON Web Token (JWT) as the standard container for metadata. It extends JWT with additional `claims` to represent the structural, descriptive, and technical metadata of the resources.

## 2. Summary

In general, the proposed standard extends the JWT standard by adding additional claims to embed metadata related to media resources and aims to group as many media types as possible into a common subset of tags that apply to all media and then reduce them to write specific fields with the ultimate goal of promoting interoperability and federation of multimedia resources in decentralized systems.

## 3. Motivation

Currently, the majority of media resources are transmitted through centralized systems that are managed by a central authority. This authority controls the consumption, transmission, and management of the resources. However, in decentralized environments such as IPFS, there is a lack of standardization or specification defining the metadata structure for multimedia resources.

The absence of standardization presents significant challenges in managing resources, ensuring their security, ownership, and transmitting resources among all participating nodes. Additionally, managing digital rights of resources transmitted across the network presents another substantial challenge, as there are no organic action mechanisms in place to establish proof of ownership of digital resources.

## 4. Rationale

### 4.1 Why JWT?

> Interoperability is a key benefit of using the JWT standard. JWT is a widely recognized and supported standard in many programming languages, frameworks, and tools. We strongly believe that JSON Web Tokens (JWT) can serve as a foundation for our current standard and progress towards becoming a robust and secure standard by implementing JSON Web Signature (RFC7515) and JSON Web Encrypted (RFC7516).

### 4.2 Why does it need to be signed?

> By allowing verification of the data origin through a digital signature, it becomes possible to provide "proof of ownership".
>
> Imagine a scenario in which the signature of a JWT token can be verified by multiple nodes in a network, rather than relying on a centralized machine for validation. This would create a decentralized identity system that allows any entity within the network to verify the authenticity of the media resource. For example, the verification process could be executed by leveraging a trusted identity provider within the network, such as a Decentralized Identifier (DID).

## 5. Requirements and Expectations

Terminology Note: The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 and RFC8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

### 5.1 Structure of JSON Web Token

The JSON Web Token (JWT) serves as a structured container for metadata and must adhere to the format outlined in the RFC7519 specification.

### 5.2 JOSE Header

In the context of the implementation, the `typ` header parameter MUST be included to establish the specific format of the associated multimedia resource, following the guidelines provided by IANA MediaTypes.

```json
{
    "typ": "image/jpeg",
    "alg": "ES256"
}
```

### 5.3 Additional Claims

The proposed standard introduces additional claims that represent the structural, descriptive, and technical metadata of multimedia resources. These claims serve as a starting point for a set of useful and interoperable claims. To maintain a compact representation, all names are kept short.

#### 5.3.1 Structural Metadata ("s")

Structural metadata MUST represent information that describes the internal structure of a multimedia resource. The following fields MUST be included in the **"s"** claim and interoperate according to the way the resources are stored:

```json
{
  "s": {
    "cid": "string",
    "path": "string"
  }
}
```

- "cid": It MUST be a string representing the Content Identifier (CID) of the multimedia resource or resource directory.
- "path": This field MAY be used to describe how to get to the resource if the CID points to a directory.

#### 5.3.2 Descriptive Metadata ("d")

Descriptive metadata MUST represent information that describes the content of a multimedia resource. The following fields MUST be included in the **"d"** claim, and custom fields MAY be added:

```json
{
  "d": {
    "title": "string",
    "description": "string"
  }
}
```

- "title": It MUST be a string expressing the title of the multimedia resource.
- "description": It MUST be a string expressing the description of the multimedia resource.

#### 5.3.3 Technical Metadata ("t")

Technical metadata MUST represent information that describes the technical characteristics of a multimedia resource. The following fields SHOULD be included in the **"t"** claim:

```json
{
  "t": {
    "size": "integer",
    "width": "integer",
    "height": "integer",
    "length": "integer"
  }
}
```

- "size": The size of the resource in bytes.
- "width": The horizontal resolution in pixels.
- "height": The vertical resolution in pixels.
- "length": The duration of the audio/video in milliseconds.

#### 5.3.4 Additional Metadata ("x")

Additional metadata MUST represent optional information that enhances the usability and management of a multimedia resource. The **"x"** claim SHOULD group additional elements:

```json
{
  "x": {
    "attachments": [
      {
        "cid": "string",
        "type": "string",
        "title": "string",
        "description": "string"
      }
    ],
    "custom_fields": {
      "field_name": "value"
    }
  }
}
```

- "attachments": Array of related resources.
  - "cid": CID of the attachment.
  - "type": MIME type.
  - "title": Title of the attachment.
  - "description": Description of the attachment.
- "custom_fields": Key-value pairs for custom metadata.

## 6. Serialization

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used for authentication and authorization. There are two main types: signed (JWS) and encrypted (JWE).

Serialization formats:

1. **JSON Compact Serialization** – URL-safe, compact string.
2. **JSON Serialization** – JSON object representation:
   - General JSON Syntax
   - Flattened JSON Syntax

The standard MUST use General JSON Syntax with DAG-JOSE serialization.

## 7. Standard Implementation Example

```json
{
   "header": {
      "typ": "video/mp4",
      "alg": "ES256"
   },
   "payload": {
      "s": {
         "cid": "QmZG1jK2zYyzdHZtkZb9f9Uu3qQ2Ru6yvLjWFRV8ZuM6aM",
         "path": "/videos/example_video.mp4"
      },
      "d": {
         "title": "A Brief Tour of the Solar System",
         "desc": "This video provides an overview of the planets and other objects in our solar system.",
         "author": "NASA",
         "location": "Outer Space",
         "tags": [
            "solar system",
            "planets",
            "NASA"
         ],
         "language": "English"
      },
      "t": {
         "size": 1024576,
         "width": 1280,
         "height": 720,
         "codec": "h.264",
         "length": 180000,
         "fps": "30fps"
      },
      "x": {
         "attachments": [
           {
             "cid": "bafkreigh2akiscaildc2yit6dlq4ldcqojzj74f6h4fkbdf5wjfoffaxoe",
             "type": "text/plain",
             "title": "Readme file",
             "description": "Detailed explanation of the resource."
           }
         ],
         "creator_notes": "This video is part of a public education series by NASA.",
         "custom_fields": {
           "difficulty_level": "Beginner",
           "estimated_viewing_time": "3 minutes"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

## 8. Conclusion

This standard defines a mechanism for encoding and transmitting metadata related to multimedia resources over decentralized systems. The use of JWTs enables interoperability, security and federation. The proposed claims define the structural, descriptive, and technical aspects of multimedia metadata. Implementation MUST comply with this specification.
