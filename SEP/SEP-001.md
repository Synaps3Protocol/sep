### Introduction

The purpose of this document is to present a proposed standard for transmitting and managing multimedia resources over decentralized networks for achieving interoperability and federation of such resources.

### Scope

This standard defines a mechanism for encoding and transmitting metadata related to multimedia resources over decentralized networks. The proposed standard is based on the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as the container structure for the metadata, and is extended with additional claims to represent the structural and descriptive metadata of the resources.

### Requirements and Expectations

This standard is governed by the principles established in RFC2119, which means that it uses the following keywords to indicate the level of requirement:

1. **MUST**: indicates an absolute requirement.
2. **SHOULD**: indicates a strong recommendation, but not mandatory.
3. **MAY**: indicates an option that may be considered, but is not mandatory.

### Structure of JSON Web Token

The JWT used as the container structure for the metadata MUST follow the basic structure defined in the RFC7519 specification.

Based on the context of the implementation, extending the standard for creating the `header` of the JSON Web Token (JWT) by including the `typ` claim MUST be used to establish the `format` of the multimedia resource related to the context of the implementation, based on [IANA MediaTypes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).

```json
{
    "typ": "image/jpeg",
    "alg": "HS256"
}
```

### Additional Claims

The proposed standard defines the following additional "claims" to represent the structural, descriptive and technical metadata of the multimedia resources.

1. **"s" structural metadata**
    Structural metadata MUST represent information that describes the internal structure of a multimedia resource. The following fields MUST be included in the "s" claim and MAY include any other needed fields:

    ```json
    {
      "s": {
        "cid": "string"
      }
    }
    ```

    * "cid": A string representing the Content Identifier (CID) of the multimedia resource.

    The "s" claim MUST be included in the payload of the JWT metadata for each multimedia resource being transmitted over the decentralized network.

2. **"d" descriptive metadata**
    Descriptive metadata MUST represent information that describes the content of a multimedia resource. The following fields MUST be included in the "d" claim and MAY include any other needed fields:

    ```json
    {
      "d": {
        "title": "string",
        "desc": "string"
      }
    }
    ```

    * "title": The title of the multimedia resource.
    * "desc": The description of the multimedia resource.

    The "d" claim MUST be included in the payload of the JWT metadata for each multimedia resource being transmitted over the decentralized network.

3. **"t" technical metadata**
    Technical metadata MUST represent information that describes the technical characteristics of a multimedia resource. The following fields MUST be included in the "t" claim and MAY include any other needed fields:

    ```json
    {
      "t": {
        "size": "integer"
      }
    }
    ```

    * "size": An integer representing the size of the resource in bytes.

    The "t" claim MAY be included in the payload of the JWT metadata for each multimedia resource being transmitted over the decentralized network.

### Conclusion

This standard defines a mechanism for encoding and transmitting metadata related to multimedia resources over decentralized networks. The use of JSON Web Tokens as the container structure for metadata enables interoperability and federation of such resources. The proposed standard defines the necessary additional claims to represent the structural, descriptive, and technical metadata of multimedia resources. The implementation of this standard MUST follow the specifications and expectations defined in this document.
