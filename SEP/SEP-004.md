# SEP-004: License Metadata Standard

**Status:** Draft **|** **Category:** Standards

**Discussions-to:** [SEP-004: License Metadata Standard for On-Chain Attestations](https://github.com/orgs/Synaps3Protocol/discussions/7)

## 1. Abstract

> **Terminology Note:** The key words **"MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY"**, and **"OPTIONAL"** in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) and [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174.html) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

This document defines a standardized schema for license metadata embedded in on-chain attestations within the Synapse protocol. The goal is to enable interoperable, semantically-rich licensing agreements that complement access policies enforced by the protocol, allowing creators to optionally attach legally enforceable usage conditions.

The schema is:
- **Modular** – Optional per policy
- **Cryptographically Anchored** – Embedded in attestations
- **Compatible** – Aligned with licensing models such as Creative Commons, SPDX, and ECL

## 2. Motivation

Existing attestations in Synapse validate access permissions technically but lack a standardized method to express licensing intent or legal scope.

This proposal enables:
- Declarative and transparent licensing
- Optional legal expressiveness by creators
- Interoperability across ecosystems

Example use cases include:
- Commercial broadcast rights with territorial restrictions
- Institutional licenses for educational access
- Personal-use access under structured licenses

## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Usage Context

The `LicenseMetadata` schema:
- MAY be declared by the content creator
- SHOULD be constructed and embedded at the time of attestation issuance
- MUST be stored within the `data` field of the attestation
- MUST be compatible with JSON and ABI-encodable for on-chain use

### 3.2 LicenseMetadata Schema (JSON)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://{LINK}/license-metadata.schema.json",
  "title": "Synapse License Metadata",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "licenseType": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "General license category. Example: 'broadcast', 'retail', 'educational'"
    },
    "purpose": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Intended use. Example: 'commercial', 'non-commercial', 'personal', 'archival'"
    },
    "territory": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Geographic scope. Example: 'global', 'LATAM', 'US-only'"
    },
    "revocable": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "Indicates whether the license can be revoked by the issuer"
    },
    "exclusivity": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["exclusive", "non-exclusive"],
      "description": "Level of exclusivity granted to the licensee"
    },
    "schemaVersion": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Version of the license schema. Example: 'Synapse-License-v0.1'"
    },
    "termsURI": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uri",
      "description": "Canonical URI to the full legal license document (e.g., IPFS, Arweave, HTTPS)"
    },
    "termsHash": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Optional SHA-256 hash (hex-encoded) of the legal terms file referenced in termsURI"
    },
    "contentID": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Content hash of the asset under license"
    }
  },
  "required": [],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

### 3.3 Solidity Struct (on-chain form)

```solidity
struct LicenseMetadata {
  string licenseType;
  string purpose;
  string territory;
  bool revocable;
  string exclusivity;
  string schemaVersion;
  string termsURI;
  string termsHash;
  string contentID;
}
```

## 4. Compatibility with Existing Standards

The following table outlines compatibility with common licensing and attestation standards:

| Standard | Mapping | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Creative Commons (CC)** | `licenseType`, `purpose`, `territory` | Used in digital and educational content; enables modular attribution, commercial use, etc. |
| **SPDX** | `schemaVersion`, `licenseType`, `termsURI` | Open-source license registry with global identifiers (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0) |
| **ECL** | `revocable`, `exclusivity`, `territory` | Framework for audiovisual and territorial content licensing in Europe |
| **EAS** | Compatible via `data` payload | Ethereum Attestation Service, compatible with Synapse attestations |
| **ODRL (W3C)** | Indirect via `termsURI` | Semantic framework for permissions, prohibitions, duties |
| **MPEG-21 REL / WIPO REL** | `termsURI` (future support) | Legal metadata for digital rights expressions |

These references guide interoperability and implementation alignment.

## 5. Security & Validity Considerations

- The `termsURI` MUST point to a verifiable document. When referencing decentralized storage systems like IPFS or Arweave, integrity is inherently ensured by the URI itself;  so `termsHash` is OPTIONAL. Otherwise, such as in mutable sources (e.g., HTTPS), `termsHash` SHOULD be included to guarantee auditability and MUST match the canonical content of the referenced file.
- Legal interpretation MUST be handled off-chain. Smart contracts SHOULD NOT attempt to interpret or enforce legal terms, which are inherently off-chain and context-dependent. For interpretation constraints, see also Section 8.
- Creators MAY issue licenses to entities for content use cases not mediated or enforced by the Synapse protocol. In such cases, enforcement MAY be enhanced through:
  - Guardian nodes ensuring custody-aware delivery of the asset
  - Cryptographic access control systems like LIT Protocol for time-limited or identity-bound decryption
  - Content watermarking for auditability and misuse tracing

## 6. Example Attestation Embedding

```solidity
LicenseMetadata memory license = LicenseMetadata({
  licenseType: "broadcast",
  purpose: "commercial",
  territory: "LATAM",
  revocable: false,
  exclusivity: "non-exclusive",
  schemaVersion: "Synapse-License-v0.1",
  termsURI: "ipfs://bafy.../license.pdf",
  termsHash: "bafylrs245...", // license.pdf hash
  contentID: "bafybeibz..."
});

bytes memory payload = abi.encode(license);
attestationProvider.attest(..., payload); // Embed license metadata in the attestation
```

## 7. Conclusion

This SEP defines a modular, cryptographically anchored, and legally-aware licensing standard for on-chain attestations in Synapse. It provides a formal mechanism for creators to convey enforceable usage scopes and obligations without compromising on-chain neutrality, protocol flexibility, or legal extensibility.

When referencing legal terms via `termsURI`, these documents SHOULD be versioned, hash-anchored, and MAY be signed digitally (e.g., with PGP, notarization, or services like DocuSign) to ensure authenticity and enforceability.

## 8. License Interpretation Rules

By default, attestations represent proof of technical access only. They MUST NOT be interpreted as legal licenses unless accompanied by valid and verifiable `LicenseMetadata`.

Any attestation lacking license metadata SHALL be considered to grant **no external usage rights**, and its enforceability is limited strictly to protocol-level access control.

## 9. Extended Use Cases & Legal Interoperability

The license metadata model defined in this SEP enables creators to authorize use of content beyond the standard consumption model enforced by Synapse protocols. This is particularly important for off-chain or non-native distribution environments where usage still requires auditability and legal clarity.

### 9.1 Educational Use Case

A content creator may grant an educational institution access to a licensed resource for in-classroom transmission. The attestation ensures that only the authorized school account may access the content, while the `LicenseMetadata` details:

- `purpose`: "educational"
- `territory`: "US-only"
- `revocable`: false
- `termsURI`: legal document specifying usage scope and limitations

The license may include restrictions like:
- No redistribution outside enrolled students
- Time-limited use
- Attribution requirements

All of this is cryptographically anchored to the attestation, providing strong evidence of terms agreed upon.

### 9.2 Commercial Content Leasing

Creators may lease content to third parties (e.g., advertising firms, enterprises) for specific commercial purposes outside of the protocol environment. Licensing metadata defines usage rights and complements access control policies:

- `licenseType`: "rental"
- `purpose`: "commercial"
- `territory`: "global"
- `revocable`: true
- `termsURI`: signed legal contract for commercial usage

This approach enables:
- Programmatic monetization through license issuance
- Legal interoperability with off-chain actors
- Integrity-assured and court-admissible licensing records

These use cases showcase how SEP-004 acts as a foundational layer for **programmable, traceable, and enforceable licensing beyond the protocol**.
