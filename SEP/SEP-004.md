# SEP-004: License Metadata Standard

**Status:** Draft **|** **Category:** Standards

**Discussions-to:** [SEP-004: License Metadata Standard for On-Chain Attestations](https://github.com/orgs/Synaps3Protocol/discussions/7)

## 1. Abstract

> **Terminology Note:** The key words **“MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”**, and **“OPTIONAL”** in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) and [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174.html) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

This document defines a standardized schema for license metadata embedded in on-chain attestations within the Synapse protocol. The goal is to enable interoperable, semantically-rich licensing agreements that complement access policies enforced by the protocol, allowing creators to optionally attach legally meaningful usage conditions.

The schema is:
- **Modular** – Optional per policy
- **Verifiable** – Anchored to attestations
- **Compatible** – Aligned with licensing models such as Creative Commons, SPDX, and ECL


## 2. Motivation

Current attestations in Synapse encode the technical validity of access but lack a standardized mechanism to express licensing intent, restrictions, or legal scope of use.

This proposal enables:
- Declarative and transparent licensing
- Optional legal expressiveness by creators
- Interoperability across ecosystems

Example use cases include:
- Commercial broadcast rights with territorial restrictions
- Institutional licenses for educational access
- Personal-use access under structured licenses


## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Usage Context

The `LicenseMetadata` schema:
- MAY be declared by the content creator
- SHOULD be constructed and embedded at the time of attestation issuance
- MUST be stored within the `data` field of the attestation
- MUST be compatible with JSON and ABI-encodable for on-chain use

### 3.2 LicenseMetadata Schema (JSON)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://{LINK}/license-metadata.schema.json",
  "title": "Synapse License Metadata",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "licenseType": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "General license category. Example: 'broadcast', 'retail', 'educational'"
    },
    "purpose": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Intended use. Example: 'commercial', 'non-commercial', 'personal', 'archival'"
    },
    "territory": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Geographic scope. Example: 'global', 'LATAM', 'US-only'"
    },
    "revocable": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "Indicates whether the license can be revoked by the issuer"
    },
    "exclusivity": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["exclusive", "non-exclusive"],
      "description": "Level of exclusivity granted to the licensee"
    },
    "schemaVersion": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Version of the license schema. Example: 'Synapse-License-v0.1'"
    },
    "termsURI": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uri",
      "description": "Canonical URI to the full legal license document (e.g., IPFS, Arweave, HTTPS)"
    },
    "termsHash": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Optional SHA-256 hash of the legal terms file referenced in termsURI"
    },
    "contentID": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Content hash of the asset under license"
    }
  },
  "required": [],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```


### 3.3 Solidity Struct (on-chain form)

```solidity
struct LicenseMetadata {
  string licenseType;
  string purpose;
  string territory;
  bool revocable;
  string exclusivity;
  string schemaVersion;
  string termsURI;
  string termsHash;
  string contentID;
}
```

## 4. Compatibility with Existing Standards

| Standard | Mapping | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Creative Commons (CC)** | `licenseType`, `purpose`, `territory` | Used in digital and educational content; enables modular attribution, commercial use, etc. |
| **SPDX** | `schemaVersion`, `licenseType`, `termsURI` | Open-source license registry with global identifiers (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0) |
| **ECL** | `revocable`, `exclusivity`, `territory` | Framework for audiovisual and territorial content licensing in Europe |
| **EAS** | Compatible via `data` payload | Ethereum Attestation Service, compatible with Synapse attestations |
| **ODRL (W3C)** | Indirect via `termsURI` | Semantic framework for permissions, prohibitions, duties |
| **MPEG-21 REL / WIPO REL** | `termsURI` (future support) | Legal metadata for digital rights expressions |

These references guide interoperability and implementation alignment.


## 5. Security & Validity Considerations

- The `termsURI` MUST be hash-verifiable if it points to a legal document. The hash (e.g., SHA-256) SHOULD be included in the attestation or resolvable off-chain.
- IPFS or Arweave SHOULD be used to guarantee persistence and verifiability.
- License terms MUST be interpreted off-chain; smart contracts SHOULD NOT enforce legal semantics.
- A `termsHash` MAY be included to assert the document’s integrity. If present, this hash MUST match the canonical content of the legal document.


## 6. Example Attestation Embedding

```solidity
LicenseMetadata memory license = LicenseMetadata({
  licenseType: "broadcast",
  purpose: "commercial",
  territory: "LATAM",
  revocable: false,
  exclusivity: "non-exclusive",
  schemaVersion: "Synapse-License-v0.1",
  termsURI: "ipfs://bafy.../license.pdf",
  termsHash: "bafylrs245...", // license.pdf hash
  contentID: "bafybeibz..."
});

bytes memory payload = abi.encode(license);
attestationProvider.attest(..., payload);
```


## 7. Conclusion

This SEP defines a modular, verifiable, and legally-aware licensing standard for on-chain attestations in Synapse. It enables creators to express usage permissions, terms, and conditions without compromising technical neutrality or flexibility.

When referencing legal terms via `termsURI`, these documents SHOULD be versioned, hash-anchored, and MAY be signed digitally (e.g., with PGP, notarization, or services like DocuSign) to ensure authenticity and enforceability.


## 8. License Interpretation Rules

By default, attestations represent proof of technical access only. They MUST NOT be interpreted as legal licenses unless accompanied by valid and verifiable `LicenseMetadata`.

Any attestation lacking license metadata SHALL be considered to grant **no external usage rights**, and is enforceable only within the protocol.

## 9. Extended Use Cases & Legal Interoperability

The license metadata model defined in this SEP enables creators to authorize use of content beyond the standard consumption model enforced by Synapse protocols. This is particularly important for off-chain or non-native distribution environments where usage still requires auditability and legal clarity.

### 9.1 Educational Use Case

A content creator may grant an educational institution access to a licensed resource for in-classroom transmission. The attestation ensures that only the authorized school account may access the content, while the `LicenseMetadata` details:

- `purpose`: "educational"
- `territory`: "US-only"
- `revocable`: false
- `termsURI`: legal document specifying usage scope and limitations

The license may include restrictions like:
- No redistribution outside enrolled students
- Time-limited use
- Attribution requirements

All of this is cryptographically anchored to the attestation, providing strong evidence of terms agreed upon.

### 9.2 Commercial Content Leasing

Creators may lease content to third parties (e.g., advertising firms, enterprises) for specific commercial purposes outside of the protocol environemt (e.g., protocol clients). Policies control who receives the asset, and licensing metadata records the nature of usage rights:

- `licenseType`: "rental"
- `purpose`: "commercial"
- `territory`: "global"
- `revocable`: true
- `termsURI`: signed legal contract for commercial usage

This approach enables:
- Programmatic monetization through license issuance
- Legal interoperability with off-chain actors
- Verifiable and court-admissible licensing records

These use cases showcase how SEP-004 acts as a foundational layer for **programmable, traceable, and enforceable licensing beyond the protocol**.
