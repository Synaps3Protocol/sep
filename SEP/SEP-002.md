# SEP-002: Comprehensive Metadata Standard for Decentralized Systems

**Status:** Draft **|** **Category:** Standards

## 1. Introduction

This document articulates a sophisticated framework for the transmission and management of multimedia metadata within decentralized systems. The proposed standard is designed to foster interoperability, security, and federation of multimedia resources by defining a comprehensive metadata structure while accommodating a plurality of serialization formats.

## 2. Summary

SEP-002 delineates a universal metadata schema tailored for multimedia resources and prescribes guidelines for its seamless integration into decentralized ecosystems. Diverging from its antecedent, SEP-001, this standard eschews dependency on a singular serialization format, such as JSON Web Token (JWT), in favor of supporting a spectrum of formats. These include JSON, CBOR, Protobuf, and XML, each selected to address distinct technical prerequisites and use cases.

## 3. Motivation

The current landscape predominantly relies on centralized systems for the dissemination of media resources, wherein a single authority governs access, transmission, and management. In decentralized infrastructures, such as IPFS, the absence of a standardized metadata schema engenders significant challenges. These include safeguarding resource integrity, affirming ownership, and ensuring effective data interchange across nodes. Furthermore, the lack of a unified framework exacerbates interoperability hurdles, complicating cross-system integrations.

## 4. Rationale

### 4.1 The Imperative of Serialization Flexibility

Serialization flexibility is indispensable for achieving:

1. **Interoperability:** Catering to diverse serialization preferences across systems and applications.
2. **Performance Optimization:** Enabling compact data representations, such as CBOR and Protobuf, in environments constrained by bandwidth or computational capacity.
3. **Extensibility:** Allowing seamless adoption of emergent serialization methodologies without necessitating foundational revisions.

### 4.2 Metadata Verification and Security

Although the standard refrains from enforcing a prescriptive security model, it strongly advocates the utilization of cryptographic signatures or proofs compatible with the selected serialization format. These mechanisms are critical for ensuring data authenticity, integrity, and protection against unauthorized alterations.

## 5. Requirements and Expectations

Terminology Note: The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 and RFC8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

### 5.1 Metadata Structure

The metadata schema is segmented into four cardinal components:

#### 5.1.1 Structural Metadata ("s")

This segment encapsulates the intrinsic structural attributes of a multimedia resource. Mandatory fields include:

```json
{
  "s": {
    "type": "string",
    "cid": "string",
    "path": "string"
  }
}
```

- `type`: Specifies the MIME type, adhering to IANA Media Types.
- `cid`: Denotes the Content Identifier (CID) of the resource.
- `path`: Provides a relative pathway for resource retrieval, particularly when `cid` references a directory.

#### 5.1.2 Descriptive Metadata ("d")

This component describes the semantic content of the multimedia resource. Required fields include:

```json
{
  "d": {
    "title": "string",
    "description": "string"
  }
}
```

- `title`: Represents the resource's title.
- `description`: Provides a narrative description of the resource.

#### 5.1.3 Technical Metadata ("t")

This segment delineates the technical specifications of the resource. Recommended fields include:

```json
{
  "t": {
    "size": "integer",
    "width": "integer",
    "height": "integer",
    "length": "integer"
  }
}
```

- `size`: Indicates resource size in bytes.
- `width`: Specifies horizontal resolution in pixels.
- `height`: Denotes vertical resolution in pixels.
- `length`: Defines the duration (in milliseconds) for audiovisual media.

#### 5.1.4 Additional Metadata ("x")

This optional segment accommodates supplementary metadata for enhanced resource management. Example structure:

```json
{
  "x": {
    "attachments": [
      {
        "cid": "string",
        "type": "string",
        "title": "string",
        "description": "string"
      }
    ],
    "custom_fields": {
      "field_name": "value"
    }
  }
}
```

- `attachments`: Details ancillary resources linked to the primary asset.
- `custom_fields`: Provides a flexible key-value structure for bespoke metadata.

### 5.2 Serialization Formats

Serialization MUST adhere to one of the following formats, chosen for their versatility and operational efficacy:

1. **JSON:** Praised for its human-readable syntax, JSON is invaluable in debugging scenarios and manual metadata inspection.
2. **CBOR:** Renowned for compactness, CBOR is ideal for bandwidth-limited or resource-constrained environments, such as IoT.
3. **Protobuf:** A schema-driven format ensuring stringent data consistency and efficient encoding/decoding processes.
4. **XML:** A verbose format favored in legacy systems requiring highly structured data.

Serialization SHOULD incorporate cryptographic signatures, ensuring data integrity and authenticity. Recommended algorithms include:

- **JSON:** JSON Web Signature (JWS).
- **CBOR:** CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE).
- **Protobuf:** External signature protocols.
- **XML:** XML Signature.

## 6. Example

Illustrated below is an exemplary JSON serialization:

```json
{
  "s": {
    "type": "video/mp4",
    "cid": "QmZG1jK2zYyzdHZtkZb9f9Uu3qQ2Ru6yvLjWFRV8ZuM6aM",
    "path": "/videos/example_video.mp4"
  },
  "d": {
    "title": "A Brief Tour of the Solar System",
    "description": "Overview of planets and objects in the solar system."
  },
  "t": {
    "size": 1048576,
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 720,
    "length": 180000
  },
  "x": {
    "attachments": [
      {
        "cid": "bafkreigh2akiscaildc2yit6dlq4ldcqojzj74f6h4fkbdf5wjfoffaxoe",
        "type": "text/plain",
        "title": "Readme file",
        "description": "Explanation of the resource."
      }
    ],
    "custom_fields": {
      "difficulty": "beginner",
      "estimated_view_time": "3 minutes"
    }
  }
}
```

## 7. Conclusion

SEP-002 promulgates a robust and extensible framework for multimedia metadata management in decentralized contexts. Its emphasis on flexible serialization formats and a universal metadata schema enhances system interoperability, scalability, and security.
