# SEP-002: Comprehensive Metadata Standard for Decentralized Systems

**Status:** Draft
**Category:** Standards

## 1. Introduction

This document articulates a sophisticated framework for the transmission and management of multimedia metadata within decentralized systems. The proposed standard is designed to foster interoperability, security, and federation of multimedia resources by defining a comprehensive metadata structure while accommodating a plurality of serialization formats.

## 2. Summary

SEP-002 delineates a universal metadata schema tailored for multimedia resources and prescribes guidelines for its seamless integration into decentralized ecosystems. Diverging from its antecedent, SEP-001, this standard eschews dependency on a singular serialization format, such as JSON Web Token (JWT), in favor of supporting a spectrum of formats. These include JSON, CBOR, Protobuf, and XML, each selected to address distinct technical prerequisites and use cases.

## 3. Motivation

The current landscape predominantly relies on centralized systems for the dissemination of media resources, wherein a single authority governs access, transmission, and management. In decentralized infrastructures, such as IPFS, the absence of a standardized metadata schema engenders significant challenges. These include safeguarding resource integrity, affirming ownership, and ensuring effective data interchange across nodes. Furthermore, the lack of a unified framework exacerbates interoperability hurdles, complicating cross-system integrations.

## 4. Rationale

### 4.1 The Imperative of Serialization Flexibility

Serialization flexibility is indispensable for achieving:

1. **Interoperability:** Catering to diverse serialization preferences across systems and applications.
2. **Performance Optimization:** Enabling compact data representations, such as CBOR and Protobuf, in environments constrained by bandwidth or computational capacity.
3. **Extensibility:** Allowing seamless adoption of emergent serialization methodologies without necessitating foundational revisions.

### 4.2 Metadata Verification and Security

Although the standard refrains from enforcing a prescriptive security model, it strongly advocates the utilization of cryptographic signatures or proofs compatible with the selected serialization format. These mechanisms are critical for ensuring data authenticity, integrity, and protection against unauthorized alterations.

## 5. Requirements and Expectations

**Terminology Note:** The key words **“MUST”**, **“MUST NOT”**, **“REQUIRED”**, **“SHALL”**, **“SHALL NOT”**, **“SHOULD”**, **“SHOULD NOT”**, **“RECOMMENDED”**, **“MAY”**, and **“OPTIONAL”** in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) and [RFC8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174.html).

A conforming implementation of this standard **MUST** adhere to the metadata schema and serialization rules defined below. Implementations **MAY** support multiple serialization formats, but **MUST** maintain structural equivalence across formats.

### 5.1 Metadata Schema

The metadata **MUST** be structured into the following four top-level components:

* `"s"`: Structural metadata
* `"d"`: Descriptive metadata
* `"t"`: Technical metadata
* `"x"`: Additional metadata

Each component is defined as a JSON-like object and **MUST** be represented equivalently in all supported serialization formats.

#### 5.1.1 Structural Metadata (`"s"`)

The `"s"` object **MUST** include the following fields:

| Field  | Requirement | Description                                   |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `cid`  | REQUIRED    | Content Identifier of the resource (IPFS CID) |
| `type` | REQUIRED    | MIME type of the resource (IANA Media Type)   |

The field `path` **MAY** be included to describe resource location when `cid` references a directory.

```json
"s": {
  "type": "video/mp4",
  "cid": "Qm...",
  "path": "/media/example.mp4"
}
```

#### 5.1.2 Descriptive Metadata (`"d"`)

The `"d"` object **MUST** include the following fields:

| Field         | Requirement | Description                        |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `title`       | REQUIRED    | Title of the multimedia resource   |
| `description` | REQUIRED    | Textual description of the content |

Implementers **MAY** extend this object with additional fields such as `author`, `tags`, `language`, etc.

#### 5.1.3 Technical Metadata (`"t"`)

The `"t"` object **SHOULD** include the following fields, depending on the nature of the media:

| Field    | Requirement | Description                              |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `size`   | REQUIRED    | Resource size in bytes                   |
| `width`  | OPTIONAL    | Horizontal resolution (for video/images) |
| `height` | OPTIONAL    | Vertical resolution (for video/images)   |
| `length` | OPTIONAL    | Duration in milliseconds (for AV media)  |

If a media type is not visual (e.g., audio), implementers **MAY** omit `width` and `height`.

#### 5.1.4 Additional Metadata (`"x"`)

The `"x"` object **MAY** be included to provide supplementary metadata for extended use cases.

##### Attachments

If present, the `attachments` array **MUST** follow this schema:

```json
"x": {
  "attachments": [
    {
      "cid": "string",
      "type": "string",
      "title": "string",
      "description": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Custom Fields

The `custom_fields` object **MAY** be used for key-value extensions:

```json
"custom_fields": {
  "field_name": "value"
}
```

Field names **SHOULD** avoid conflicts with existing keys.

### 5.2 Serialization Formats

Implementations **MUST** support at least one of the following serialization formats:

* **JSON**
* **CBOR**
* **Protobuf**
* **XML**

Serialization **MUST** preserve the logical structure and field semantics defined above. Implementations **SHOULD** use compact formats (e.g., CBOR, Protobuf) in constrained environments, and human-readable formats (e.g., JSON, XML) for compatibility or debugging.

### 5.3 Cryptographic Verification

Each serialization **SHOULD** support cryptographic signing to ensure integrity and authenticity. Implementations **MAY** adopt format-specific signing standards:

| Format   | Recommended Signature Spec          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| JSON     | JSON Web Signature (JWS, RFC7515)   |
| CBOR     | CBOR Object Signing (COSE, RFC8152) |
| Protobuf | External digital signatures         |
| XML      | XML Signature (W3C XML-DSig)        |

Signatures **MUST** be verifiable using standard cryptographic libraries and algorithms compliant with the selected spec.

### 5.4 Conformance Declaration

An implementation **MUST** declare conformance to SEP-002 if:

* It supports at least one REQUIRED serialization format.
* It includes all REQUIRED fields per the schema.
* It follows the rules for cryptographic verification (if signing is implemented).
* It maintains schema equivalence across serializations.


## 6. Example

{
  "s": {
    "type": "video/mp4",
    "cid": "QmZG1jK2zYyzdHZtkZb9f9Uu3qQ2Ru6yvLjWFRV8ZuM6aM",
    "path": "/videos/example_video.mp4"
  },
  "d": {
    "title": "A Brief Tour of the Solar System",
    "description": "Overview of planets and objects in the solar system."

  "t": {
    "size": 1048576,
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 720,
    "length": 180000
  },
  "x": {
    "attachments": [

        "cid": "bafkreigh2akiscaildc2yit6dlq4ldcqojzj74f6h4fkbdf5wjfoffaxoe",
        "type": "text/plain",
        "title": "Readme file",
        "description": "Explanation of the resource."
      }
    ],
    "custom_fields": {
      "difficulty": "beginner",
      "estimated_view_time": "3 minutes"
    }
  }
}
```

## 7. Conclusion

SEP-002 promulgates a robust and extensible framework for multimedia metadata management in decentralized contexts. Its emphasis on flexible serialization formats and a universal metadata schema enhances system interoperability, scalability, and security.
